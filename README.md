# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/disaster_model.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

### Data and cleaning details:
The first part of my data pipeline is the Extract, Transform, and Load process. Here, I read the dataset, clean the data, and then store it in a SQLite database. I have done the data cleaning with pandas. To load the data into an SQLite database, I have use the pandas dataframe .to_sql() method.
